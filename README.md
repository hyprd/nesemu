# nesemu
NES emulator written in Rust.

Operational although incomplete feature-wise. It can play Pac-Man and Mario, although the emulation running 2-3x the regular speed makes them kinda hard. 

### Todo
- Implement APU
- More precise PPU timing
- Add the last few illegal opcodes
- Extend mapper support (allow single/4-screen nametable mirroring)
- Fix PPU bugs, mainly scrolling errata
- Probably more!
